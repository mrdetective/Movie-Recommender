## Structure

The website follows a structured process to provide movie recommendations to the users. The steps involved in this process can be summarized as follows:

- User Genre Input: The website accepts genre input from the user. This allows users to specify their preferred movie genre as a basis for receiving relevant recommendations.

- Genre-Based Movie Retrieval: Using Chat GPT, the website retrieves movie names that are associated with the user-input genre. This process ensures that the recommendations are aligned with the genre preferences expressed by the user.

- Movie Information Retrieval: The website then fetches detailed information about the recommended movies from the Open Movie Database (OMDB). This step enables the website to provide comprehensive and accurate details about each movie, including plot summaries, ratings, cast, and other relevant information.

By following this structured approach, the website ensures that users receive personalized movie recommendations based on their chosen genre, while also providing comprehensive movie details sourced from the OMDB database.
